# getDevJob(you) 

> This repo is the home of the getDevJob application.

getDevJob(you) is a job listing website created by developers for developers. When we were scrolling through numerous job boards, we came across a striking similarity between them. The websites were bland and didn't grab our attention. And so, we wanted to create a new experience for job-seekers in the tech industry.

The application was built utilizing a ReactJS front-end and a PHP back-end with a MySQL database.
